% About

My name is Kartik. I work as a software engineer at [Shipsy](https://shipsy.io){target="_blank"}. I hack on system software in free time.

My main programming languages are Typescript, Javascript, C++, Python, Go and Rust, but I have some experience with bash, Java, Lua and Ruby. My preferred OS is Linux but I work fine in Windows and MacOS.

I like solving puzzles, and tend to learn new skills and knowledge quickly.

I am conscious of the importance of security and aware of most security best practices (I think).
